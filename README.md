# NBA Height Prediction from Performance


- Machine learning models used to predict the height of basketball players, from playstyle and performance statistics.
- Models: Gradient boosted regressors and classifiers, random forests
- Data analysis: Clustering, preparing clean data for better performance.

The preprocessing, analysis is done inside the `ml.ipynb` notebook, meanwhile data collection and some cleaning is done in `fetch_players.ipynb`. The data is stored in the `data` folder.

More information soon.
